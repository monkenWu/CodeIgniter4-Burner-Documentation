# Workerman Commands

### start server

When you don't pass any parameters, the server will start in debug mode by default.

```
php spark burner:start
```

By default, Burner will read the default driver in `app/Burner.php`. Of course, you can also force Burner to execute the command with the `Workerman` driver, like this:

```
php spark burner:start --driver Workerman
```

{% info Note %}

The `--driver Workerman` parameter is also suitable for all the commands mentioned below.

{% end %}

### daemon mode

Run Workerman in the background.

```
php spark burner:start --daemon
```

At this time, Burner will redirect the output to `/dev/null`, and you must define `logFile` in `app/Config/Workerman.php` :

```php
public $logFile = 'YourloggingPath/workerman.log';
```

### stop server

```
php spark burner:stop
```

### restart server

The server will be closed and restarted.

```
php spark burner:restart
```

### reload server

The server will replace all workers and load new workers.

```
php spark burner:reload
```

{% info Note %}

This method may not handle all cases, such as project file changes generated by `composer require/update`.

{% end %}

### server status

```
php spark burner:workerman status
```

### more command

Pass the command directly to the Workerman entry php file.

```
php spark burner:workerman [workerman_comands]
```

You can refer to the official [Workerman documentation](https://github.com/walkor/workerman#available-commands) to build your command.
